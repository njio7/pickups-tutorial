make sure to rename the cylinder to "coin" so it's easier to identify in the hierachy.
make the cylinder flat enough to resemble a coin shape and rotate it 90 degrees on the X axis.

you can choose to either use the capsule collider provided with the cylinder or delete the capsule collider and create a sphere collider under "Add Component".
to make sure the collider for the coin isn't too big, you can turn the size of it down to 0.5
